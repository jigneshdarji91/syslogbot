# How to contribute to Syslog Bot

- Create your own branch

  We enforce this requirement so that master contains well-tested and fully-developed code only.

- Complete development

  You know what should be done here. Or at least you should know what needs to be done. If you don't, talk to other contributors.

- Rebase with master
```
git rebase master
```

- Test your development.

  If not successful, make changes, rebase, test, repeat.
- Create pull request

  Go to the repo page on the web and create a pull request.

- Review

  Do not merge the code by yourself. Wait for at least 2 folks to review your changes.

- Cheers üç∫
